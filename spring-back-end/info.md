# Spring Boot Back-end

## Overview

This codebase represents a **complete** Spring Boot (3.2) back-end that will run on your local
machine out of the box. This branch has a health check endpoint that can be reached by navigating
to http://localhost:5001/health. This demo is intended to help give you a starting point with Spring Boot
to tinker and expand while learning the tech.

### Getting Started

1. Clone this repo to your local machine

- `$ git clone https://github.com/pjl-software/full-stack-auth-repo.git`

2. Change directories into this directory and checkout this branch (_00-spring-boot-setup-local_)

- `$ cd full-stack-auth-repo/spring-back-end && git checkout 00-spring-boot-setup-local`

3. Run the application

- `$ ./bin/startup-scripts/build-and-run`

And Voil√†! You have a back-end server up and running.

### Test The Running Application

Because we are only running on HTTP (HTTPS is on branch `01-run-server-local-on-https`), most browser will not let
you navigate to http://localhost:5001/health. Therefore, to test you can run `CURL -X GET http://localhost:5001/health`.

### Assumptions

- I'm developing this on a Mac, and that's the only OS I'm testing it on. I'm confident it will run on Linux as
  well.
- I'm also
  using [Amazon Corretto 17](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/corretto/latest/corretto-17-ug/what-is-corretto-17.html)
