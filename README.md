# Spring Boot / Angular Authentication Repo

This is will eventually be a fully fledged user authentication application built with a Spring Boot (3.2+) back-end,
Angular front-end, and PostgreSQL datastore that will run on Docker. The repo will be runnable with a few key strokes
and with minimal local requirements.

## Why Are you Building This?

I don't like tutorials or reading raw documentation. What _I_ want when I'm learning something new, is a working
replica that I can tinker with to learn and build upon through trial and error. My goal is to provide this to
whoever learns like me in hopes that it helps them build some incredible stuff.

## How Are you Building This?

I'm starting small by breaking up logical chunks of the total effort into standalone branches that you can use
to follow along as the codebase builds up in complexity. If you don't care, no problem! Just checkout the `master`
branch and get it running. If you are looking for more context however, you can checkout the different branches
and watch the [Code Review walkthrough videos](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL2yILnfj7oN5Zggsb8latQequI1PJnqzn) I paired with them explaining the code and reasoning.
